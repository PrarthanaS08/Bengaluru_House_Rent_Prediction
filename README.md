# Bengaluru House Rent Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house rent prices in Bengaluru using machine learning regression techniques. The model analyzes various property-related features to estimate rental prices accurately, helping tenants, landlords, and real estate analysts make data-driven decisions.

# Project Objective

To build a regression-based machine learning model that predicts house rent based on factors such as:

Location

Size (BHK)

Area (sq. ft.)

Number of bathrooms

Furnishing status

Availability & other relevant features

# Machine Learning Approach

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Regression Models (Linear Regression / Random Forest / etc.)

Model Evaluation using metrics like R² Score, MAE, MSE

# Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

# Outcome

The final model predicts house rent with good accuracy and highlights the most influential factors affecting rental prices in Bengaluru.

# Dataset

The dataset contains real-world housing rental data from Bengaluru and is used for educational and analytical purposes.

# Use Cases

Rent price estimation

Real estate market analysis
